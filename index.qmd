# Hi, I'm <span class="gradient_text">Nhan</span>.

I am a PhD candidate in Accounting at UC3M, preparing to join the job market in 2024-2025. I was a visiting scholar at UNC-Chapel Hill from January to May 2024.

My <span class="gradient_text"><strong><a href="research/index.html" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none; text-decoration: underline;">research interest</a></strong></span> focuses on comtemporary reporting and auditing issues related to technology, society, and sustainability. To support that, I specialize intensively in data science methods such as machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, which I apply to both corporate reporting and alternative data sources.

I'm ready to teach financial accounting and auditing courses, leveraging my professional and <span class="gradient_text"><strong><a href="teaching/index.html" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">teaching background</a></strong></span>. I'm also keen to lead research and data-oriented courses, supervise student theses, and mentor PhD students as needed.
